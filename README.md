To add a feature or fix a bug create an issue in the issues tab. From that page add a description and any labels that are fitting. Create a branch for the issue using the "Development" tab on the right of the page. Once the changes are complete a PR can be submitted. At least one other member must review and approve the changes. To be approved proof of testing needs added to the PR (console logs, pictures or videos).

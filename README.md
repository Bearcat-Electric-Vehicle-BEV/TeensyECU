# TeensyECU
Repository for code regarding Teensy 4.1 used by BEV

## Compiling
The code is dependent on https://github.com/Richard-Gemmell/teensy4_i2c. Please see https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries for instructions on how to install into Ardiuno IDE. 

## Development
Please be careful when programming and editting code. We got no money and Teensys are hard to come by. Consider peer review before uploading.
